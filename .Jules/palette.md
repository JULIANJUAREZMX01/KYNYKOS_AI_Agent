## 2026-11-04 - Accessible Tablists and Non-blocking Async Feedback in Vanilla Dashboards
**Learning:** In minimalist dashboards with vanilla JS and Tailwind, native `alert()` disrupts asynchronous workflows and keyboard navigation breaks if tab switching relies on `event.target` (which can reference inner text or emoji nodes). Incorporating standard WAI-ARIA tab semantics (`role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `role="tabpanel"`, `aria-labelledby`) alongside targeted ID-based tab button activation and polite live regions (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`) delivers screen reader support, clear focus visibility, and responsive inline status feedback without external component libraries.
**Action:** Always prefer ARIA-annotated tab widgets with `focus-visible:ring-2` and polite live regions over native modal alerts for async form actions.
